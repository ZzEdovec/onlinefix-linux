## üì¶ Dependencies
Before using the launcher, make sure the following packages are installed:
- `ffmpeg`
- `steam`
- `icoextract` (optional) ‚Äì for better extraction of icons from .exe files
- `aria2` (optional) ‚Äì for downloading games

‚ÄºÔ∏è These must be installed as regular packages. Flatpak and Snap versions **are not supported and will not be!** If you use them, the launcher will not work correctly ‚Äì and this is not the developer's fault.
## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation
If you are using Arch Linux or an Arch-based distribution, install the package [onlinefix-linux-launcher-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/onlinefix-linux-launcher-bin) from the AUR (for example, `yay -S onlinefix-linux-launcher-bin`).
If you are using a different distribution, use the installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/ZzEdovec/onlinefix-linux/releases) section.
## üèó Building from Source
To build the launcher, you will need [DevelNext](https://develnext.org):
1. Open DevelNext
2. Clone the repository to any folder on your disk:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZzEdovec/onlinefix-linux
```
3. Open the `.dnproject` file in DevelNext
4. A message about missing dependencies will appear, find and install them from GitHub
5. Click the build button at the top of the window

After building, you will get the launcher executable file.
