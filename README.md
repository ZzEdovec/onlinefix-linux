## üì¶ Dependencies

Before using the launcher, make sure the following packages are
installed:\
- `ffmpeg`\
- `steam`\
- `icoextract` (optional) -- for better icon extraction from `.exe`\
- `aria2` (optional) -- for downloading games

‚ÄºÔ∏è They **must** be installed as regular system packages. Flatpak and
Snap versions are **not supported and never will be!**\
If you use them, the launcher will not work correctly --- and this is
not the developer's fault.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

You can download a ready-to-use installer from the
[Releases](https://github.com/ZzEdovec/onlinefix-linux/releases)
section.

## üèó Building from source

To build the launcher you'll need [DevelNext](https://develnext.org):

1.  Open DevelNext\
2.  Clone the repository into any folder on your disk:\

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ZzEdovec/onlinefix-linux
```

3.  Open the `.dnproject` file in DevelNext\
4.  A message about missing dependencies will appear --- find and
    install them from GitHub\
5.  Press the build button at the top of the window

After building, you will get the executable file of the launcher.
