# OnlineFix Linux Launcher

**A simple and convenient launcher for running games from ****[online-fix.me](https://online-fix.me)**** on Linux**

## ‚ú® Features

- Launch games without the need to manually set `WINEDLLOVERRIDES` and other configurations
- Automatically fetch game covers from Steam
- Retrieve game icons
- Create desktop and application menu shortcuts for games

## ‚ùï Compatibility

Currently, most online fixes from online-fix.me are supported.
Fixes that include custom launchers (e.g., Phasmophobia) have not been tested yet.

Work-in-progres:
- Epic Games fixes
- Steam fixes from freetp.org

## üì¶ Dependencies

Before using the launcher, ensure that the following packages are installed:

- `protontricks`
- `ffmpeg`
- `7zip`

### Installing Dependencies:

#### SteamOS / Steam Deck:

1. Disable the read-only mode for the file system:
   ```bash
   sudo steamos-readonly disable
   ```
2. Edit `/etc/pacman.conf` and set `SigLevel = TrustAll`
   - **Warning:** Using `TrustAll` disables package signature verification, which can pose security risks. However, without this change, `pacman` does not function properly on SteamOS.
   - You can use `nemo` or `kate` to edit the file:
     ```bash
     sudo nemo /etc/pacman.conf
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     sudo kate /etc/pacman.conf
     ```
3. Enable the **Chaotic AUR** repository by following the [official instructions](https://aur.chaotic.cx/docs)
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -Sy protontricks-git p7zip
   ```
5. After installation, it is recommended to re-enable the read-only mode:
   ```bash
   sudo steamos-readonly enable
   ```

#### Ubuntu and derivatives:

```bash
sudo apt install protontricks ffmpeg p7zip-full
```

#### Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install protontricks ffmpeg p7zip
```

#### Arch Linux and derivatives:


If you do not have `yay` installed, first install it:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm git
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-bin.git
cd yay-bin
makepkg -si
cd ..
rm -rf yay-bin
```

Then install all dependencies using:

```bash
yay -S --noconfirm protontricks ffmpeg 7zip
```

#### Solus:

```bash
sudo eopkg install protontricks ffmpeg p7zip
```
